In the previous chapters, we've been dealing with commands and pipelines that take care of an entire task at once.
In practice, however, you may find yourself facing a task which requires the same command or pipeline to run multiple times.
For, example, you may need to:

- Scrape hundreds of web pages
- Make dozens of API calls and transform their output
- Train a classifier for a range of parameter values
- Generate scatter plots for every pair of features in your dataset

In any of the above examples, there's a certain form of repetition involved.
With your favorite scripting or programming language, you take care of this with a for loop or a while loop.
On the command line, the first thing you might be inclined to do is to press **`Up`** to bring back the previous command, modify it if necessary, and press **`Enter`** to run the command again.
This is fine for two or three times, but imagine doing this dozens of times.
Such an approach quickly becomes cumbersome, inefficient, and prone to errors.
The good news is that you can write such loops on the command line as well.
That's what this chapter is all about.

Sometimes, repeating a fast command on after the other (in a *serial* manner) is sufficient.
When you have multiple cores (and perhaps even multiple machines) it would be nice if you could make use of those, especially when you’re faced with a data-intensive task.
When using multiple cores or machines, the total running time of may be reduced significantly.
In this chapter I will introduce a very powerful tool called `parallel`[@parallel] that can take care of exactly this. It enables you to apply a command or pipeline for a range of arguments such as numbers, lines, and files.
Plus, as the name implies, it allows you to run your commands in *parallel*.


## Overview

This intermezzo chapter discusses several approaches to speed up tasks that require commands and pipelines to be run many times.
My main goal is to demonstrate to you the flexibility and power of `parallel`.
Because this tool can be combined with any other tool discussed in this book, it will positively change the way you use the command line for data science.
In this chapter, you’ll learn about:

- Running commands in serial to a range of numbers, lines, and files
- Breaking a large task into several smaller tasks
- Running pipelines in parallel
- Distributing pipelines to multiple machines

This chapter starts with the following files:

```{console cd}
cd /data/ch08
l
```

The instructions to get these files are in [Chapter 2](#chapter-2-getting-started).

## Serial Processing

Before I dive into parallelization, I'll briefly discuss looping in a serial fashion.
It’s worthwhile to know how to do this because this functionality is always available, the syntax closely resembles looping in other programming languages, and it will really make you appreciate `parallel`.

From the examples provided in the introduction of this chapter, we can distill three types of items to loop over: numbers, lines, and files.
These three types of items will be discussed in the next three subsections, respectively.


### Looping Over Numbers

Imagine that you need to compute the square of every even integer between 0 and 100. There’s a tool called `bc`[@bc], which is basically a calculator on the command line where you can pipe an equation to.
The command to compute the square of 4 looks as follows:

```{console bc}
echo "4^2" | bc
```

For a one-off calculation, this will do.
However, as mentioned in the introduction, you would need to be crazy to press **`Up`**, change the number, and press **`Enter`** 50 times!
In this case it's better to let the shell do the hard work for you by using a for loop:

```{console for_loop}
for i in {0..100..2}  #<1> <2>
do
echo "$i^2" | bc      #<3>
done | trim
```
<1> The Z shell has a feature called brace expansion, which transforms *{0..100..2}* into a list separated by spaces: *0 2 4 … 98 100*.
<2> The variable *i* is assigned the value *1* in the first iteration, *2* in the second iteration, and so forth.
<3> The value of this variable can be used by prefixing it with a dollar sign *\$*. The shell will replace *\$i* with its value before `echo` is being executed. Note that there can be more than one command between `do` and `done`.

Although the syntax may appear a bit odd compared to your favorite programming language, it's worth remembering this because it's always available in the shell.
I'll introduce a better and more flexible way of repeating commands in a moment.


### Looping Over Lines

The second type of items you can loop over are lines.
These lines can come from either a file or from standard input.
This is a very generic approach because the lines can contain anything, including: numbers, dates, and email addresses.

Imagine that you'd want to send an email to all your contacts.
Let’s first generate some fake users using the free [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me):

```{console emails}
curl -s "https://randomuser.me/api/1.2/?results=5&seed=dsatcl2e" > users.json
< users.json jq -r '.results[].email' > emails
bat emails
```

You can loop over the lines from *emails* with a while loop:

```{console while_loop}
while read line                         #<1>
do
echo "Sending invitation to ${line}."   #<2>
done < emails                           #<3>
```
<1> In this case you need to use a while loop because the Z shell does not know beforehand how many lines the input consists of.
<2> Although the curly braces around the *line* variable are not necessary in this case (since variable names cannot contain periods), it’s still good practice.
<3> This redirection can also be placed before `while`.

You can also provide input to a while loop interactively by specifying the special file standard input */dev/stdin*. Press **`Ctrl-D`** when you are done.

```{console while_interactive}
while read line; do echo "You typed: ${line}."; done < /dev/stdin#! expect_prompt=FALSE
one#! expect_prompt=FALSE
two#! expect_prompt=FALSE
three#! expect_prompt=FALSE
C-D#! literal=FALSE, expect_prompt=TRUE
```

This method, however, has the disadvantage that, once you press **`Enter`**, the commands between `do` and `done` are run immediately for that line of input. There's no turning back.


### Looping Over Files

In this section I discuss the third type of item that we often need to loop over: files.

To handle special characters, use *globbing* (i.e., pathname expansion) instead of `ls`[@ls]:

```{console for}
for chapter in /data/*
do
echo "Processing Chapter ${chapter}."
done
```

Just as with brace expansion, the expression `/data/\**` is first expanded into a list by the Z shell before it's being processed by the for loop.

A more elaborate alternative to listing files is `find`[@find], which:

- Can traverse down directories
- Allows for elaborate searching on properties such as size, access time, and permissions
- Handles special characters such as spaces and newlines

For example, the following `find` invocation lists all files located under the directory */data* that have *csv* as extension and are smaller than 2 kilobyte:

```{console find_csv}
find /data -type f -name '*.csv' -size -2k
```


## Parallel Processing

Let's say that you have a very long running tool, such as the one shown here:

```{console bat_slow, callouts=list("RANDOM", "sleep")}
bat slow.sh
```
<1> The magic variable *RANDOM* calls an internal Bash function that returns a pseudorandom integer between 0 and 32767. Taking the remainder of the division of that integer by 5 and adding 1 ensures that *duration* is between 1 and 5.
<2> `sleep` pauses execution for a given number of seconds.

This process probably doesn't take up all the available resources.
And it so happens that you need to run this command a lot of times.
For example, you need to download a whole sequence of files.

A naive way to parallelize is to run the commands in the background.
Let's run `slow.sh` three times:

```{console subshell, keep_last_prompt=TRUE, callouts=list(2, 4)}
for i in {A..C}; do
./slow.sh $i &
done#! hold=7
```
<1> The ampersand sends the command to the background, allowing the for loop to continue immediately with the next iteration.
<2> This line shows the job number given by the Z shell and the process ID, which can be used for more fine-grained job control. This topic, while powerful, is beyond the scope of this book.


```{block2, type="rmdnote"}
Keep in mind that not everything can be parallelized.
API calls may be limited to a certain number, or some commands can only have one instance.
```

There are two problems with this naive approach.
First, there’s no way to control how many processes you are running concurrently.
If you start too many jobs at once, your system may run out of memory.
Second, it's difficult to tell which output belongs to which input.
Let's look at a better approach.



### Introducing GNU Parallel

Allow me to introduce `parallel`, a command-line that allows you to parallelize and distribute commands and pipelines.
<!-- TODO: MUST: More exciting intro needed -->
The beauty of this tool is that existing tools can be used as they are; they do not need to be modified.

```{block2, type="rmdcaution"}
Be aware that there are two command-line tools with the name `parallel`.
If you're using the Docker image then you already have the correct one installed.
Otherwise, you can check that you have the correct one by running `parallel --version`.
It should say "GNU parallel".
```

Before I go into the details of `parallel`, here’s a little teaser to show you how easy it is to replace the for-loop from earlier:

```{console teaser_2}
seq 0 2 100 | parallel "echo {}^2 | bc" | trim
```

<!-- find /usr/share/man/man1/ | -->
<!-- parallel --tag 'man {} | grep -oE -- "(-[-_:alnum:])|(--[-_[:alnum:]]+)" | sort | uniq | wc -l' 2>/dev/null | sort -nrk2 | head -n 20 -->

This is `parallel` in its simplest form: the items to loop over are passed via standard input and there aren't any any arguments other than the command that `parallel` needs to run.
As you can see it basically acts as a for loop.
Here's another teaser, which replaces the for loop from the previous section.

```{console teaser_1}
parallel --jobs 2 ./slow.sh ::: {A..C}
```

Here, using the `--jobs` option, I specify that `parallel` can run at most two jobs concurrently. The arguments to `slow.sh` are specified as an argument instead of via standard input.

With a whopping 159 different options, `parallel` offers a lot of functionality.
Perhaps too much.
Luckily you only need to know a handful in order to be effective.
The manual page is quite informative in case you need to use a more obscure option.


### Specifying Input

The most important argument to `parallel`, is the command or pipeline that you'd like to run for every input.
The question is: where should the input item be inserted in the command line?
If you don't specify anything, then the input item will be appended to the end of the pipeline.

```{console, remove="keep"}
seq 3 | parallel cowsay#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
parallel --jobs 1 --keep-order cowsay ::: 1 2 3
```

The above is the same as running:

```{console}
cowsay 1 > /dev/null #<1>
cowsay 2 > /dev/null
cowsay 3 > /dev/null
```
<1> Because the output is the same as before, I redirect it to */dev/null* to suppress it.

Although this often works, I advise you to be explicit about where the input item should be inserted in the command by using placeholders.
In this case, because you want to use the entire input line (a number) at once, you only need one placeholder.
You specify the placeholder, in other words, where to put the input item, with a pair of curly braces (`{}`):

```{console}
seq 3 | parallel cowsay {} > /dev/null
```


```{block2, type="rmdnote"}
There are other ways to provide input to `parallel`.
I prefer piping the input (as I do throughout this chapter) because that's how most command-line tools are chained together into a pipeline.
The other ways involve syntax that's not seen anywhere else.
Having said that, they do enable additional functionality, such as iterating over all possible combinations of multiple lists, so be sure to read `parallel`s manual page if you like to know more.
```

When the input items are filenames, there are a couple of modifiers you can use only parts of the filename.
For example, with `{/}`, only the basename of the filename will be used:

```{console}
find /data/ch03 -type f | parallel echo '{#}\) File \"{}\" has basename \"{/}\"'
```

If the input line has multiple parts separated by a delimiter you can add numbers to the placeholders.For example:

```{console remove="touch"}
touch input.csv
< input.csv parallel --colsep , "mv {2} {1}" > /dev/null#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
```

Here, you can apply the same placeholder modifiers.
It is also possible to reuse the same input item.
If the input to `parallel` is a CSV file with a header, then you can use the column names as placeholders:

```{console}
< input.csv parallel -C, --header : "invite {name} {email}"#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
```

```{block2, type="rmdtip"}
If you ever wonder whether your placeholders are set up correctly, you can add the `--dryrun` option.
Instead of actually executing the command, `parallel` will print out all the commands exactly as if they would have been executed.
```


### Controlling the Number of Concurrent Jobs

By default, parallel runs one job per CPU core.
You can control the number of jobs that will be run concurrently with the `--jobs` or `-j` option.
Simply specifying a number means that many jobs will be run concurrently.
If you put a plus sign in front of the number then `parallel` will run *N* jobs plus the number of CPU cores. If you put a minus sign in front of the number then parallel will run *N-M* jobs.
Where *N* is the number of CPU cores.
You can also specify a percentage, where the default is 100% of the number of CPU cores.
The optimal number of jobs to run concurrently depends on the actual commands you are running.

<!-- #TODO: Figure out where to type concurrently instead of parallel. And make sure all occurences of parallel are surrounded by backticks -->

```{console}
seq 5 | parallel -j0 "echo Hi {}"
```

```{console}
seq 5 | parallel -j200% "echo Hi {}"
```

If you specify `-j1`, then the commands will be run in serial. Even though this doesn’t do the name of the tool of justice, it still has its uses. For example, when you need to access an API which only allows one connection at a time. If you specify `-j0`, then parallel will run as many jobs in parallel as possible. This can be compared to your loop with the ampersand. This is not advised.


### Logging and Output

To save the output of each command, you might be tempted to the following:

```{console}
seq 5 | parallel "echo \"Hi {}\" > hi-{}.txt"
```

This will save the output into individual files.
Or, if you want to save everything into one big file you could do the following:

```{console}
seq 5 | parallel "echo Hi {}" >> one-big-file.txt
```

However, `parallel` offers the `--results` option, which stores the output of each job into a separate file, where the filename is based on the input values:

```{console}
seq 5 | parallel --results outdir "echo Hello from job {}"
tree outdir
```

<!-- #TODO: Explain the files seq, stderr, and stdout -->

When you're running multiple jobs in parallel, the order in which the jobs are run may not correspond to the order of the input.
The output of jobs is therefore also mixed up.
To keep the same order, simply specify the `--keep-order` option or `-k` option.

Sometimes it’s useful to record which input generated which output.
`parallel` allows you to *tag* the output with the `--tag` option, which prepends each line with the input item.

```{console tag}
seq 5 | parallel --tag "echo 'sqrt({})' | bc -l"
parallel --tag --keep-order "echo '{1}*{2}' | bc -l" ::: 3 4 ::: 5 6 7
```


### Creating Parallel Tools

The `bc` tool, which I used in the beginning of the chapter, is not parallel by itself.
However, you can parallelize it using `parallel`.
The Docker image contains a tool called `pbc` [@pbc].
Its code is shown here:

```{console bat_pbc}
bat $(which pbc)
```

This tool allows us to simplify the code used in the beginning of the chapter too.
And it can process comma-separated values simultaneously:

```{console run_pbc}
seq 100 | pbc '{1}^2' | trim
paste -d, <(seq 4) <(seq 4) <(seq 4) | pbc 'sqrt({1}+{2})^{3}'
```


## Distributed Processing

Sometimes you need more power than your local machine, even with all its cores, can offer.
Luckily, `parallel` can also leverage the power of remote machines, which really allows you to speed up your pipeline.

What’s great is that `parallel` doesn't have to be installed on the remote machine.
All that’s required is that you can connect to the remote machine with the *Secure Shell* protocol (or SSH), which is also what `parallel` uses to distribute your pipeline.
(Having `parallel` installed is helpful because it can then determine how many cores to employ on each remote machine; more on this later.)

<!-- #TODO: Introduce AWS EC2 -->
<!-- #TODO: COULD: Talk about Google Cloud and MS Azure -->

First, I'm going to obtain a list of running AWS EC2 instances.
Don’t worry if you don’t have any remote machines, you can replace any occurrence of `--slf hostnames`, which tells `parallel` which remote machines to use, with `--sshlogin :`.
This way, you can still follow along with the examples in this section.

Once you know which remote machines to take over, we’re going to consider three flavors of distributed processing:

- Simply running ordinary commands on remote machines
- Distributing local data directly among remote machines
- Sending files to remote machines, process them, and retrieve the results


### Get List of Running AWS EC2 Instances

<!-- #TODO: Add links to GCP And Azure -->

In this section we’re creating a file named *hostnames* that will contain one hostname of a remote machine per line.
I'm using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an example.
I assume that you have an AWS account and that you know how to launch instances.
If you’re using a different cloud computing service (such as Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure), or if you have your own servers, please make sure that you create a *hostnames* file yourself before continuing to the next section.

<!-- #TODO: Add link to AWS Management console -->

You can obtain a list of running AWS EC2 instances using `aws` [@aws], the command-line interface to the AWS API.
With `aws`, you can virtually do everything you can do with the online AWS Management Console.

<!-- #TODO: Change the URL below into a footnote -->

The command `aws ec2 describe-instances` returns a lot of information about all your EC2 instances in JSON format (see [the online documentation](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) for more information).
You can extract the relevant fields using `jq`:

<!-- TODO: Run these EC2 commands once for real in the docker image and use a bunch of echo statements -->

```{console, remove="echo"}
aws ec2 describe-instances | jq '.Reservations[].Instances[] | {public_dns: .PublicDnsName, state: .State.Name}'#! enter=FALSE
C-C#!literal=FALSE
echo '{'
echo '  "state": "running",'
echo '  "public_dns": "ec2-54-88-122-140.compute-1.amazonaws.com"'
echo '}'
echo '{'
echo '  "state": "stopped",'
echo '  "public_dns": null'
echo '}'
```

The possible states of an EC2 instance are: *pending*, *running*, *shutting-down*, *terminated*, *stopping*, and *stopped*.
Because you can only distribute your pipeline to running instances, you filter out the non-running instances as follows:

```{console, remove="echo"}
aws ec2 describe-instances | jq -r '.Reservations[].Instances[] | select(.State.Name=="running") | .PublicDnsName' | tee hostnames#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
echo 'ec2-54-88-122-140.compute-1.amazonaws.com'
echo 'ec2-54-88-89-208.compute-1.amazonaws.com'
```

(Without the `-r` or `--raw-output` option, the hostnames would have been surrounded by double quotes.)
The output is saved to *hostnames*, so that I can pass this to `parallel` later.

<!-- #TODO: Add link to instructions on how to do this. -->

As mentioned, `parallel` employs `ssh`[@ssh] to connect to the remote machines.
If you want to connect to your EC2 instances without typing the credentials every time, you can add something like the following text to the file *\~/.ssh/config*.

```
Host *.amazonaws.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/MyKeyFile.pem
    User ubuntu
```

Depending on your which distribution your running, your user name may be different than *ubuntu*.

### Running Commands on Remote Machines

The first flavor of distributed processing is to simply run ordinary commands on remote machines.
Let’s first double check that `parallel` is working by running the tool `hostname`[@hostname] on each EC2 instance:

```{console, remove="echo"}
parallel --nonall --sshloginfile hostnames hostname#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
echo 'ip-172-31-23-204'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-205'
```

Here, the `--sshloginfile`  or `--slf` option is used to refer to the file *hostnames*.
The `--nonall` option instructs `parallel` to execute the same command on every remote machine in the *hostnames* file without using any parameters.
Remember, if you don’t have any remote machines to utilize, you can replace `--slf hostnames` with `--sshlogin :` so that the command is run on your local machine:

```{console, remove="echo"}
parallel --nonall --sshlogin : hostname#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
echo 'data-science-toolbox'
```

Running the same command on every remote machine once only requires one core per machine. If you wanted to distribute the list of arguments passed in to `parallel` then it could potentially use more than one core. If the number of cores are not specified explicitly, `parallel` will try to determine this.

```{console, remove="fake"}
alias fake=echo
seq 2 | parallel --slf hostnames echo 2>&1#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
fake 'bash: parallel: command not found'
fake -n 'parallel: Warning: Could not figure out number of cpus on' &&
fake ' ec2-54-88-122-140.compute-1.amazonaws.com (). Using 1.'
fake '1'
fake '2'
```

In this case, I have `parallel` installed on one of the two remote machines.
I'm getting a warning message indicating that `parallel` is not found on one of them.
As a result, `parallel` cannot determine the number of cores and will default to using one core.
When you receive this warning message, you can do one of the following four things:

- Don’t worry, and be happy with using one core per machine
- Specify the number of jobs for each machine via the `--jobs` or `-j` option
- Specify the number of cores to use per machine by putting, for example, *2/* if you want two cores, in front of each hostname in the *hostnames* file
- Install `parallel` using a package manager. For example, if the remote machines all run Ubuntu:

```{console}
parallel --nonall --slf hostnames "sudo apt-get install -y parallel"#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
```


### Distributing Local Data among Remote Machines

The second flavor of distributed processing is to distribute local data directly among remote machines.
Imagine that you have one very large dataset that you want to process it using multiple remote machines.
For simplicity, let's sum all integers from 1 to 1000.
First, let’s double check that your input is actually being distributed by printing the hostname of the remote machine and the length of the input it received using `wc`:

```{console, remove="echo"}
seq 1000 | parallel -N100 --pipe --slf hostnames "(hostname; wc -l) | paste -sd:"#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
echo 'ip-172-31-23-204:100'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-205:100'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-205:100'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-204:100'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-205:100'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-204:100'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-205:100'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-204:100'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-205:100'
echo 'ip-172-31-23-204:100'
```

Excellent. You can see that your 1000 numbers get distributed evenly in subsets of 100 (as specified by `-N100`).
Now, you’re ready to sum all those numbers:

```{console, remove="echo"}
seq 1000 | parallel -N100 --pipe --slf hostnames "paste -sd+ | bc" | paste -sd+ | bc#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
echo '500500'
```

Here, you immediately also sum the ten sums you get back from the remote machines.
Let’s check that the answer is correct by doing the same calculation without `parallel`:

```{console}
seq 1000 | paste -sd+ | bc
```

Good, that works.
If you have a larger pipeline that you want to execute on the remote machines, you can also put it in a separate script and upload it script with `parallel`.
I'll demonstrate this by creating a very simple command-line tool called `add`:

```{console create_add, marker="#~"}
echo '#!/usr/bin/env bash' > add
echo 'paste -sd+ | bc' >> add
bat add
chmod u+x add
seq 1000 | ./add
```

Using the `--basefile` option, `parallel` first uploads the file *add* to all remote machines before running the jobs:

<!-- #TODO: Explain --pipe -->

```{console use_add, remove="echo"}
seq 1000 |
parallel -N100 --basefile add --pipe --slf hostnames './add' |
./add #! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
echo '500500'
```

Summing 1000 numbers is of course only a toy example.
Plus, it would've been much faster to do this locally.
Still, I hope it’s clear from this that `parallel` can be incredibly powerful.


### Processing Files on Remote Machines

The third flavor of distributed processing is to send files to remote machines, process them, and retrieve the results.
Imagine that you want to count for each borough of New York City, how often they receive service calls on 311.
You don’t have that data on your local machine yet, so let’s first obtain it from the free [NYC Open Data API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/):

```{console nyc}
seq 0 100 900 | parallel  "curl -sL 'http://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/erm2-nwe9.json?\$limit=100&\$offset={}' | jq -c '.[]' | gzip > nyc-{#}.json.gz"
```

You now have 10 files containing compressed JSON data:

```{console nyc_ls}
l nyc*json.gz
```

Note that `jq -c '.[]'` is used to flatten the array of JSON objects so that there’s one object per line, with a total of 100 lines per file.
Using `zcat` [@zcat], you directly print the contents of a compress file:

```{console zcat_trim}
zcat nyc-1.json.gz | trim
```

Let’s see what one line of JSON looks like using:

```{console zcat_head_1}
zcat nyc-1.json.gz | head -n 1
```

If you were to get the total number of service calls per borough on your local machine, you would run the following command:

```{console}
zcat nyc*json.gz |
jq -r '.borough' |
tr '[A-Z] ' '[a-z]_' |
sort | uniq -c | sort -nr |
awk '{print $2","$1}' |
header -a borough,count |
csvlook
```

Because this is quite a long pipeline, and because I'm using it again in a moment with `parallel`, it’s worth to go over it:

- Expand all compressed files using `zcat`
- For each call, extract the name of the borough using `jq`
- Convert borough names to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores (because `awk` splits on whitespace by default)
- Count the occurrences of each borough using `sort` and `uniq`
- Reverse the two columns and delimit them by comma delimited using `awk`
- Add a header using `header`
- Sort by count and print table using `csvsort` [@csvsort]

Imagine, for a moment, that your own machine is so slow that you simply cannot perform this pipeline locally.
You can use `parallel` to distribute the local files among the remote machines, let them do the processing, and retrieve the results:

```{console}
ls *.json.gz |
parallel -v --basefile jq \
--trc {.}.csv \

"zcat {} | ./jq -r '.borough' | tr '[A-Z] ' '[a-z]_' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print \$2\",\"\$1}' > {.}.csv"#! enter=FALSE

```{console, include=FALSE}
ls *.json.gz |
parallel -v --basefile jq \
--trc {.}.csv \
--sshlogin : \
"zcat {} | jq -r '.borough' | tr '[A-Z] ' '[a-z]_' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print \$2\",\"\$1}' > {.}.csv"
```

This long command breaks down as follows:

- Print the list of files and pipe it into `parallel`
- Transmit the `jq` binary to each remote machine. Luckily, `jq` has no dependencies. This file will be removed from the remote machines afterwards because I specified the `--trc` option (which implies the `--cleanup` option). Note that the pipeline uses `./jq` instead of just `jq`. That's because the pipeline needs to use the version which was uploaded and not the version that may or may not be on the search path.
- The command-line argument `--trc {.}.csv` is short for `--transfer --return {.}.csv --cleanup`. (The replacement string *{.}* gets replaced with the input filename without the last extension.) Here, this means that the JSON file gets transferred to the remote machine, the CSV file gets returned to the local machine, and both files will be removed after each job from the remote machine
- Specify a list of hostnames. Remember, if you want to try this out locally, you can specify `--sshlogin :` instead of `--slf hostnames`
- Note the escaping in the `awk` expression. Quoting can sometimes be tricky. Here, the dollar signs and the double quotes are escaped. If quoting ever gets too confusing, remember that you put the pipeline into a separate command-line tool just as I did with `add`

If you, at some point during this process, run `ls` on one of the remote machines, you would see that `parallel` indeed transfers (and cleans up) the binary `jq`, the JSON files, and CSV files:

```{console, remove="echo"}
ssh $(head -n 1 hostnames) ls#! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
echo 'nyc-1.json.csv'
echo 'nyc-1.json.gz'
echo 'jq'
```

Each CSV file looks something like this:

```{console, remove="echo"}
cat nyc-1.json.csv #! enter=FALSE
C-C#! literal=FALSE
echo 'bronx,3'
echo 'brooklyn,5'
echo 'manhattan,24'
echo 'queens,3'
echo 'staten_island,2'
```

You can sum the counts in each CSV file using `rush`[@rush] and the tidyverse:

```{console}
cat nyc*csv | header -a borough,count |
rush run -t 'group_by(df, borough) %>% summarize(count = sum(count))' - |
csvsort -rc count | csvlook
```

Or, if you prefer to use SQL to aggregate results, you can use `csvsql` as discussed in [Chapter 5](#chapter-5-scrubbing-data):

```{console}
cat nyc*csv | header -a borough,count |
csvsql --query 'SELECT borough, SUM(count) AS count FROM stdin GROUP BY borough ORDER BY count DESC' |
csvlook
```


## Discussion

As data scientists, we work with data, and sometimes a lot of data.
This means that sometimes you need to run a command multiple times or distribute data-intensive commands over multiple cores.
In this chapter I have shown you how easy it is to parallelize commands.
`parallel` is a very powerful and flexible tool to speed up ordinary command-line tools and distribute them over multiple cores and remote machines. It offers a lot of functionality and in this chapter I’ve only been able to scratch the surface. Some features of `parallel` are that I haven’t covered:

- Different ways of specifying input
- Keep a log of all the jobs
- Only start new jobs when the machine is under a certain load
- Timeout, resume, and retry jobs

Once you have a basic understanding of `parallel` and its most important options, I recommend that you take a look at its tutorial listed in the Further Reading section.
